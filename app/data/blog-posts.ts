# Why Online Text Tools Are Safer Than You Think

In the digital age, we constantly need to manipulate text—counting words for an essay, formatting JSON for a project, or checking grammar for an email. The instinct is to search for a free online tool. But a question often lingers: **"Is it safe to paste this here?"**

If you are dealing with sensitive data like passwords, legal documents, or proprietary code, that fear is justified. Traditionally, web tools worked by sending your data to a remote server, processing it, and sending it back. highlighting a clear risk of interception or logging.

However, a new generation of privacy-focused tools (including **Textakit**) has emerged, built on a technology called **Client-Side Processing**.

## What is Client-Side Processing?

Client-side processing means that the logic of the application runs entirely on your device (in your web browser), rather than on a remote server.

### The Old Way (Server-Side)
1. You paste text.
2. The website sends that text over the internet to a server in a data center.
3. The server processes it.
4. The result is sent back to you.

### The New Way (Client-Side)
1. You paste text.
2. **JavaScript running in your browser** processes the text instantly.
3. The result is shown immediately.
4. **Nothing leaves your computer.**

## Keys to Identifying a Safe Tool

How can you tell if a tool is processing data locally?

1.  **Instant Results**: If the output appears the millisecond you type, it's likely running locally. Network requests take time.
2.  **Works Offline**: Try loading the page, turning off your Wi-Fi, and using the tool. If it still works, it's client-side!
3.  **Privacy Policy**: Honest developers will explicitly state that "data is processed in the browser."

## Why Textakit is Privacy-First

At Textakit, we prioritize your security. Our Word Counter, Case Converter, Text Reverser, and Line Sorter are built 100% on client-side JavaScript. This means we literally **cannot** see your data even if we wanted to. It never touches our servers.

So next time you need to scrub a list of emails or format a confidential snippet, you can rest easy knowing that modern web technology is acting as your personal, private utility belt.

# 10 Common Grammar Mistakes Even Professionals Make

Your writing is a reflection of your professional image. A brilliant idea can be overshadowed by sloppy grammar, leading readers to question your attention to detail. While spell checkers catch typos, they often miss the subtle nuances of grammar.

Here are 10 common mistakes to watch out for in your next report or email.

## 1. Your vs. You're
*   **Your**: Possessive (e.g., "Your laptop is ready.")
*   **You're**: Contraction of "you are" (e.g., "You're going to be late.")
*   *Tip: If you can replace it with "you are," use "you're."*

## 2. Affect vs. Effect
This is a classic trap.
*   **Affect**: A verb meaning to influence (e.g., "The weather affected the harvest.")
*   **Effect**: A noun meaning the result (e.g., "The effect was immediate.")
*   *Memory Aid: **A**ifor **A**ction (Affect).*

## 3. It's vs. Its
*   **It's**: It is (e.g., "It's raining.")
*   **Its**: Possessive form of it (e.g., "The cat Licked its paw.")
*   *Note: Unlike other possessives, "its" has no apostrophe!*

## 4. Fewer vs. Less
*   **Fewer**: Use with countable items (e.g., "Fewer cookies," "Fewer complaints.")
*   **Less**: Use with uncountable concepts (e.g., "Less sugar," "Less time.")

## 5. The Comma Splice
This happens when you join two independent sentences with only a comma.
*   *Wrong:* I went to the store, I bought milk.
*   *Right:* I went to the store; I bought milk. (Use a semicolon)
*   *Right:* I went to the store, and I bought milk. (Use a conjunction)

## 6. Loose vs. Lose
*   **Lose**: To misplace something (verb). "Don't lose your keys."
*   **Loose**: Not tight (adjective). "This shirt is too loose."

## 7. Passive Voice Overuse
While not strictly "wrong," passive voice makes writing weak.
*   *Passive:* The report was reviewed by the manager.
*   *Active:* The manager reviewed the report.

## 8. Me, Myself, and I
*   *Wrong:* "Please send the file to John and myself."
*   *Right:* "Please send the file to John and me."
*   *Test:* Remove "John." You wouldn't say "Send the file to myself," you'd say "Send the file to me."

## 9. Compliment vs. Complement
*   **Compliment**: Flattery. "He gave her a nice compliment."
*   **Complement**: To complete or go well with. "The wine complements the meal."

## 10. Could of / Should of / Would of
This is a mishearing of the contraction.
*   *Wrong:* I could of done that.
*   *Right:* I could **have** done that (or "could've").

Mastering these ten rules will instantly elevate the clarity and professionalism of your writing. For everything else, there's always the **Textakit Grammar Checker**!

# How to Boost Your Writing Productivity by 50%

We have all been there: staring at a blinking cursor, the white page mocking us. Writer's block is the enemy of productivity. But productivity isn't about typing faster; it's about thinking clearer and structuring your workflow.

Here are five proven strategies to increase your writing output by 50% or more.

## 1. The "Vomit Draft"
Perfectionism is productivity's kryptonite. The solution? Embrace the **Vomit Draft** (or "Zero Draft").
*   **The Goal**: Just get the words out. Do not stop to fix typos. Do not research facts. Do not edit.
*   **The Logic**: You cannot edit a blank page. Once you have the raw material, molding it into shape is much easier than creating it from thin air.

## 2. Use the Pomodoro Technique
Writing is a mental marathon, but your brain works best in sprints.
*   Set a timer for 25 minutes.
*   Write without distraction.
*   Take a 5-minute break.
*   Repeat.
This creates a sense of urgency and prevents burnout.

## 3. Separate Writing from Editing
Switching between "Creator Mode" (writing) and "Critic Mode" (editing) burns mental energy.
*   **Write** in the morning when your mind is fresh.
*   **Edit** in the afternoon when you can look at the text objectively.
Never try to do both at the same time.

## 4. Eliminate Distractions (Ruthlessly)
*   **Internet**: Turn off Wi-Fi if you don't need it.
*   **Phone**: Put it in another room.
*   **Visuals**: Use a "Focus Mode" text editor (like our own distraction-free tools) that hides toolbars and menus.

## 5. Outline Before You Write
"Pantsing it" (flying by the seat of your pants) leads to dead ends. Spend 10 minutes creating a bulleted outline.
*   Intro -> Hook
*   Point 1 -> Evidence
*   Point 2 -> Evidence
*   Conclusion -> Takeaway
When you sit down to write, you're just filling in the blanks rather than inventing the structure.

## Conclusion
Productivity is a habit. Start by implementing just one of these techniques tomorrow. You'll be surprised at how much flow you can achieve when you stop fighting the process and start trusting it.

# The Ultimate Guide to Markdown

If you write on the web (GitHub, Reddit, Discord, Notion), you are likely using **Markdown**. It is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text symbols.

Unlike Microsoft Word (RTF), Markdown files are just plain text. They are future-proof, lightweight, and readable on any device.

## The Basics

### Headings
Use hash symbols (\`#\`) for headings.
\`\`\`markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
\`\`\`

### Emphasis
*   **Bold**: \`**text**\` or \`__text__\`
*   *Italic*: \`*text*\` or \`_text_\`
*   ~~Strikethrough~~: \`~~text~~\`

### Lists
**Unordered List**:
\`\`\`markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item
\`\`\`

**Ordered List**:
\`\`\`markdown
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
\`\`\`

## Intermediate Features

### Links and Images
*   **Link**: \`[Textakit](https://textakit.com)\`
*   **Image**: \`![Alt Text](/path/to/image.jpg)\`
*   *Difference*: The image tag starts with an exclamation mark \`!\`.

### Blockquotes
Use the greater-than sign (\`>\`).
> "Markdown is to writing what HTML is to web development."

## Advanced Markdown

### Code Blocks
For developers, this is essential. Wrap code in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
\`\`\`javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
\`\`\`

### Tables
Tables are a bit tricky but powerful.
\`\`\`markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
\`\`\`

## Why Learn Markdown?
1.  **Speed**: You never have to lift your hands off the keyboard to click a "Bold" button.
2.  **Portability**: It works everywhere.
3.  **Simplicity**: It forces you to focus on content, not layout.

# Case Conversion 101: A Developer's Guide

If you are new to coding, you might have noticed that different languages have different "flavors" for writing variable names. These are called **Case Styles**. Using the wrong one isn't just a stylistic error; in some languages (like Python vs. Java), it violates the community standard (PEP 8 vs. Oracle conventions).

Let's break down the "Big Three."

## 1. camelCase
**Format**: The first letter is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. No spaces or underscores.
*   *Example*: \`myVariableName\`, \`iPhone\`, \`eBay\`
*   **Where it's used**:
    *   **JavaScript**: Variables and functions.
    *   **Java**: Variables and methods.
    *   **Swift**: Properties.

## 2. PascalCase (or UpperCamelCase)
**Format**: Exactly like camelCase, but the **first letter is also Uppercase**.
*   *Example*: \`MyClassName\`, \`ReactComponent\`
*   **Where it's used**:
    *   **Classes**: Nearly all languages (JavaScript, Java, Python, C#) use PascalCase for Class names.
    *   **React**: Component names MUST be PascalCase.

## 3. snake_case
**Format**: All lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
*   *Example*: \`user_id\`, \`database_connection_string\`
*   **Where it's used**:
    *   **Python**: Variables and functions (PEP 8 standard).
    *   **Database Columns**: SQL databases traditionally prefer snake_case.
    *   **Rust**: Variables.

## 4. kebab-case
**Format**: All lowercase, separated by hyphens.
*   *Example*: \`background-color\`, \`my-cool-project\`
*   **Where it's used**:
    *   **CSS Properties**: All CSS attributes are kebab-case.
    *   **URLs**: SEO experts recommend hyphens in URLs over underscores.

## Why Does It Matter?
Consistency is key in readability. When you read \`UserAuth\`, you immediately know it's likely a **Class**. When you read \`user_auth\`, it's likely a **database field** or Python variable.

If you have a messy list of variables that need standardizing, don't rewrite them manually. efficient developers use tools like our **Case Converter** to switch between these formats instantly.

    excerpt: "Lorem Ipsum is not just gibberish. It's a carefully crafted tool that allows designers to focus on layout without being distracted by content. But is it time to move on?",
    content: `
# The Hidden Power of Lorem Ipsum

Step into any design studio, look at a wireframe, and you'll see it:
> *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...*

It looks like Latin (and it is, mostly), but why do we use it? Why not just write "Content goes here, content goes here" repeatedly?

## 1. The Psychology of Distraction
If you show a client a design draft with English text, they will inevitably start reading it.
*   *"Wait, why does the headline say 'Welcome' instead of 'Hello'?"*
*   *"There's a typo in the second paragraph."*

Suddenly, the meeting is about **copywriting**, not **design**.
**Lorem Ipsum** neutralizes this. It looks like language—it has normal sentence lengths and letter distribution—but it carries no meaning. It forces the brain to ignore the *text* and focus on the *visuals*.

## 2. Realistic Text Distribution
Typing "Text here text here" creates an unnatural visual pattern. Real language has varying word lengths. Lorem Ipsum mimics the statistical distribution of English letters effectively, giving a realistic "texture" to paragraphs.

## 3. The Origins
Believe it or not, this filler text is rooted in classical literature. It comes from Cicero's "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil), written in 45 BC. A typesetter in the 1500s scrambled it to make a type specimen book, and it survived five centuries to land on your website.

## When NOT to use Lorem Ipsum
While powerful, it has drawbacks.
1.  **False sense of space**: Lorem Ipsum fits neatly. Real content might be longer ("Honorificabilitudinitatibus") or shorter, breaking your layout.
2.  **Accessibility**: Screen readers will read it as gibberish, which is confusing for blind users testing a site.

## Alternatives
For modern designs, some prefer "Hipster Ipsum," "Bacon Ipsum," or specifically generated placeholder text that matches the topic (e.g., "Corporate Ipsum").

Regardless of the flavor, the **Lorem Ipsum Generator** remains one of the most frequently used tools in a web developer's arsenal.

# Why Every Developer Needs a Local JSON Formatter

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) has won the war. It is the de-facto standard for data exchange on the web, beating out XML.

But there is a catch. To save bandwidth, servers usually send JSON that is **minified** (all whitespace removed).

### Minified JSON:
\`{"status":"success","data":{"id":123,"user":"admin","roles":["read","write"],"history":[{"login":"2023-01-01"}]}}\`

### Formatted (Prettified) JSON:
\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "user": "admin",
    "roles": [
      "read",
      "write"
    ],
    "history": [
      {
        "login": "2023-01-01"
      }
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## The Problem with Online Formatters
When you paste an API response into a random website to format it, you are potentially exposing:
1.  **API Keys**
2.  **User Data (PII)**
3.  **Internal Database Structure**

Many "free" online formatters store the data you paste for analytics or logging. This is a massive security risk.

## The Solution: Client-Side Formatting
This is where **Textakit** shines. Our JSON Formatter/Validator runs **locally**.
*   We use your browser's built-in \`JSON.parse()\` and \`JSON.stringify()\` functions.
*   Data is processed in 10-50 milliseconds.
*   **Zero data transfer**. You can literally disconnect your internet and it will still work.

## Features to Look For
A good JSON tool should do more than just add spaces:
1.  **Validation**: It should tell you *where* the syntax error is (e.g., "Missing comma on line 5").
2.  **Collapsible Trees**: You should be able to fold large objects to focus on what matters.
3.  **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click export.

Next time you get a massive API error log, don't squint at the raw text. Prettify it securely.

# The Art of Self-Editing: How to Polish Your Own Writing

Writing is an act of passion; editing is an act of discipline. Most writers love the first part and dread the second. But the difference between a good piece and a great one rarely happens in the drafting phase—it happens in the edit.

When you are the writer *and* the editor, you face a unique challenge: you know what you *meant* to say, so your brain skips over what you *actually* wrote.

Here is a 5-step framework to master the art of self-editing.

## 1. The "Cool Down" Period
Never edit immediately after writing.
*   **Why**: Your brain is still in creative mode. You are too attached to the words.
*   **The Fix**: Step away for at least 24 hours. When you return, you will read the text as a reader, not the writer. You will be surprised at how many clumsy sentences jump out at you.

## 2. Read It Out Loud (Seriously)
This is the single most effective self-editing trick.
*   **The logic**: Your eyes scan; your ears listed.
*   If you stumble over a sentence while speaking, your reader will stumble while reading.
*    If you run out of breath, the sentence is too long.
*   If it sounds robotic, it lacks rhythm.

## 3. The "Search and Destroy" Mission
We all have "crutch words"—words we rely on when we are lazy. Do a \`Ctrl + F\` (or use our Text Analysis tools) to find and reduce these:
*   **"Very" / "Really"**: Instead of "very big," use "massive." Instead of "really tired," use "exhausted."
*   **"Just"**: It weakens your point. "I just think..." vs "I think..."
*   **"That"**: You can delete "that" 50% of the time without changing the meaning.

## 4. Kill Your Darlings
This famous advice from Arthur Quiller-Couch is painful but necessary.
Sometimes, you write a beautiful sentence. It’s witty. It’s poetic. But... it doesn't move the story forward.
*   Does this sentence support the main argument?
*   If no, cut it. No matter how much you love it.
Save these snippets in a separate "Scrap File" if you can't bear to delete them forever.

## 5. Check Structure, Then Spelling
Don't polish the brass on a sinking ship.
*   **Macro Edit**: Fix the structure first. does paragraph 3 belong before paragraph 2? Is the introduction boring?
*   **Micro Edit**: Once the flow works, *then* worry about commas, typos, and grammar. (Prom tip: Use the **Textakit Grammar Checker** for this final polish!)

Self-editing is a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger your writing becomes.

# Regular Expressions (Regex) Demystified

If you have ever looked at a string like \`^([a-zA-Z0-9._%-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6})$\` and felt a headache coming on, you are not alone.

**Regular Expressions** (or **Regex**) look like gibberish. But once you learn the basics, you unlock a superpower that lets you manipulate text in ways standard "Find and Replace" can only dream of.

## What is Regex?
Imagine you are searching a document.
*   **Standard Search**: "Find the word 'apple'."
*   **Regex Search**: "Find any word that starts with 'a', has 5 letters, and ends with 'e'."

Regex is a language for defining **patterns**.

## The 4 Symbols You Need to Know
You can solve 80% of problems with just these four concepts:

### 1. The Wildcard (\`.\`)
The dot matches **any single character**.
*   Pattern: \`c.t\`
*   Matches: "cat", "cut", "cot"
*   Ignores: "cart" (too many letters)

### 2. The Quantifiers (\`+\` and \`*\`)
*   \`+\` means "one or more."
*   \`*\` means "zero or more."
*   Pattern: \`go+d\`
*   Matches: "god", "good", "goood"

### 3. The Character Set (\`[]\`)
Matches any letter inside the brackets.
*   Pattern: \`[bcr]at\`
*   Matches: "bat", "cat", "rat"
*   Ignores: "sat"

### 4. Anchors (\`^\` and \`$\`)
*   \`^\` matches the **start** of a line.
*   \`$\` matches the **end** of a line.
*   Pattern: \`^The\`
*   Matches: "The end" (if it's the start of the line).

## Real-World Examples

### Finding Emails
You have a list of 1,000 users and you want to extract their domains.
*   Pattern: \`@\w+\.\w+\`
*   Translation: Find an "@" symbol, followed by word characters, a dot, and more word characters.

### Standardizing Dates
You have dates in "DD-MM-YYYY" and want "YYYY/MM/DD".
Regex allows you to "capture" parts of the text and rearrange them.

## Where to Use It
You don't need to code to use Regex.
1.  **Google Docs/Word**: Advanced Find features often support wildcards.
2.  **VS Code**: The standard for text editing.
3.  **Textakit**: Our upcoming **Regex Tester** tool will help you build and test these patterns visually!

Don't let the syntax scare you. Regex is strictly logical. Once it clicks, you'll wonder how you ever managed data without it.

# The Psychology of Fonts

Typography is 90% of web design. But it's also 90% of **communication tone**. Before a reader processes the meaning of your words, their brain processes the *shape* of the letters.

This is the **Psychology of Fonts**.

## 1. Serif Fonts (The Traditionalist)
*Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond*
Serif fonts have little "feet" at the ends of letters.
*   **Vibe**: Trustworthy, traditional, respectful, authoritative.
*   **Best for**: Legal documents, newspapers (The New York Times), academic papers, luxury brands (Tiffany & Co.).
*   **The Science**: The serifs guide the eye along the horizontal line, making long passages of print text easier to read.

## 2. Sans-Serif Fonts (The Modernist)
*Examples: Arial, Helvetica, Roboto (which we use here!)*
"Sans" means "without." These fonts lack the decorative feet.
*   **Vibe**: Clean, modern, approachable, tech-forward.
*   **Best for**: Tech startups, mobile apps, traffic signs, headlines.
*   **The Science**: On low-resolution digital screens, serifs can look blurry. Sans-serifs remain crisp, which is why they dominate the web.

## 3. Script Fonts (The Human)
*Examples: Lobster, Pacifico, Great Vibes*
These mimic handwriting.
*   **Vibe**: Elegant, personal, creative, or feminine.
*   **Best for**: Wedding invitations, creative headers, logos (Coca-Cola, Instagram).
*   **Warning**: Never write body text in script. It is illegible in paragraphs.

## 4. Monospace Fonts (The Machine)
*Examples: Courier New, Fira Code*
Every letter takes up the same width.
*   **Vibe**: Technical, retro, raw, unfiltered.
*   **Best for**: Displaying code snippets, screenplays, data tables.

## The "Comic Sans" Effect
Why do people hate Comic Sans? It's not a "bad" font—it was designed for comic bubbles! The problem is **context**. Using a childish handwriting font for a "Do Not Enter" sign or a medical diagnosis creates **Cognitive Dissonance**. The message says "Serious," but the font says "Playful." The brain rejects the mismatch.

## Choosing the Right Font
When typing your next document in our **Text Editor**:
1.  **Who is reading this?** (Boss = Serif; Peer = Sans).
2.  **What is the medium?** (Print = Serif; Screen = Sans).
3.  **What is the emotion?** (Serious vs. Casual).

Your font choice is the "body language" of your text. Choose wisely.

# Digital Hoarding: How to Declutter Your Notes

Physical clutter is obvious: a pile of papers on your desk. Digital clutter is insidious. It hides in folders named "New Guy stuff" or "Draft_Final_Final_v2".

If you spend more time searching for your notes than writing them, you have a digital clutter problem.

## The Cost of Clutter
A study by IDC found that knowledge workers spend **2.5 hours per day** searching for information. That is 30% of your workday lost to "Where did I save that?"

## Strategy 1: The "Touch It Once" Rule
This classic productivity rule applies perfectly to digital files. When you create a document or take a note, decide its fate immediately:
1.  **Do it**: If it takes < 2 mins, finish it now.
2.  **Define it**: If it's for later, give it a proper filename immediately (e.g., \`2026-03-ProjectAlpha-Notes.txt\`). "Untitled" is forbidden.
3.  **Delete it**: If it was a scratchpad, delete it. Do not save "just in case."

## Strategy 2: The PARA Method
Developed by Tiago Forte, PARA is the gold standard for digital organization. Sort everything into four buckets:
1.  **Projects**: Things with a deadline (e.g., "Website Launch").
2.  **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities with no deadline (e.g., "Finances", "Health").
3.  **Resources**: Things you want to keep for reference (e.g., "Design Assets", "Code Snippets").
4.  **Archives**: Completed projects.

## Strategy 3: Clean Your "Downloads" Folder
Your Downloads folder is the junk drawer of your computer.
*   **The Habit**: Every Friday at 4 PM, empty your Downloads folder. Move what you need to PARA folders; delete the rest.
*   **The Tool**: Use a script or tool to auto-delete files older than 30 days in Downloads.

## Strategy 4: Centralize Your Text
Stop writing in five different apps (Apple Notes, Notion, Google Docs, Notepad). Pick **one** "Source of Truth."
*   If you need a quick scratchpad, use **Textakit**. We are building ephemeral, privacy-first scratchpads that do not clutter your drive because they disappear when you close the tab (unless you choose to save).

## Conclusion
A clean file system leads to a clear mind. You cannot produce your best work if you are constantly fighting your own operating system. Take 15 minutes today to organize your desktop—your future self will thank you.

# Speed Reading: Superpower or Scam?

In a world overflowing with content, the promise of "Speed Reading" is seductive. Who wouldn't want to finish a business book in an hour?

Gurus claim you can triple your reading speed (from the average 250 wpm to 750+ wpm) with simple eye exercises. But what does science say?

## The Biological Limit
Research suggests that the human eye moves in "saccades"—jerky movements. We only actually "see" distinct detail during the pauses (fixations).
*   **The Hard Limit**: To physically move your eyes, fixate, and process the word, the biological ceiling for *comprehension* is around **500 words per minute (wpm)**.
*   Anyone claiming 1,000+ wpm isn't "reading." They are skimming.

## The Trade-Off: Speed vs. Comprehension
Studies consistently show a negative correlation between speed and accuracy.
*   **Fast Reading** = Low retention.
*   **Slow Reading** = High retention.

If you are reading a novel for pleasure or a textbook for learning, speed reading is actually detrimental. You miss the nuance.

## When to Skim (and How to Do It Right)
However, you don't always need 100% comprehension. If you are hunting for a specific fact in a report, "Strategic Skimming" is a valid skill.

### Technique 1: The Guider
Use your finger or a cursor to guide your eyes.
*   Move your finger continuously under the line you are reading.
*   This prevents "regression" (your eyes unconsciously jumping back to re-read words).

### Technique 2: Peripheral Expansion
Focus your eyes on the *center* of the line.
*   Don't look at the first word or the last word.
*   Use your peripheral vision to snag them. This reduces the distance your eyes travel.

### Technique 3: Subvocalization Reduction
Subvocalization is that voice in your head reading aloud.
*   **Myth**: You must silence the voice to read fast.
*   **Reality**: It's impossible to completely silence it, but you can minimize it. Try listening to instrumental music to occupy the auditory part of your brain while your visual cortex processes text.

## Conclusion
Don't fall for the "read a book a day" hype. It’s better to read one book deeply and implement its lessons than to skim ten books and remember nothing.
